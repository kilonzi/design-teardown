# DESIGN TEARDOWN

The project aims to display mastery of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles. The project is based on breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine with which you’re probably familiar by now – Smashing Magazine[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/]

The project will be using a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy and fonts from Google Web Fonts to display some random text.

# Pre-requisite

1. Browser (Project is compatiple with all modern browsers, IE is not recommended]
2. Code Editor (Sublime Text, VS Code ===> Choose your poison)
3. Github Account( You might need to use some form of version control for the project and store the code too)
# Final Product
